# 🚀 Panduan Deploy ke Netlify

## 📋 Checklist Pre-Deploy

### ✅ **Persiapan Code**
- [x] Next.js configured untuk static export
- [x] netlify.toml sudah ada
- [x] package.json build scripts ready
- [x] Environment variables documented
- [x] Mobile-responsive tested

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Deployment

### **1. Prepare Repository**
\`\`\`bash
# Ensure all files are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Netlify deployment with Neon"
git push origin main
\`\`\`

### **2. Netlify Site Setup**
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
3. Connect your Git provider (GitHub/GitLab)
4. Select your repository
5. Build settings will be auto-detected from `netlify.toml`

### **3. Environment Variables**
In Netlify Dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables:

\`\`\`env
# Required for Neon
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_connection_string
\`\`\`

### **4. Deploy Settings**
Netlify will automatically use these settings from `netlify.toml`:
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `out`
- **Node version**: 18

### **5. Custom Domain (Optional)**
1. Go to Site settings → Domain management
2. Add custom domain
3. Configure DNS records
4. Enable HTTPS (automatic)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Build Errors**
\`\`\`bash
# Common issues and solutions:

# 1. Node version mismatch
# Solution: Check netlify.toml has NODE_VERSION = "18"

# 2. Missing dependencies
# Solution: Ensure package.json has all dependencies

# 3. Environment variables
# Solution: Double-check variable names and values
\`\`\`

### **Runtime Errors**
\`\`\`bash
# 1. 404 on page refresh
# Solution: netlify.toml redirects should handle this

# 2. API calls failing
# Solution: Check environment variables are set correctly

# 3. Database connection issues
# Solution: Verify Neon URL and key, and ensure scripts/00-full-database-setup.sql was run successfully.

# 4. UUID validation errors
# Solution: Fixed with isValidUUID function in lib/db.ts
\`\`\`
